This will be a matrix computing software for some cool problem implemented by CHAO++ language, for the sake of solving the problem that matlab can't solve.
Furthermore, Ruiyu Qiu(Academician of Chinese Academy of Sciences and Academician of Chinese Academy of Engineering) who build the niubiclass Qiu operating system also strongly supports this project.
In addition,Governor Lu Xuqi spoke highly of this work,which greatly encouraged me as a vegetable chicken.
